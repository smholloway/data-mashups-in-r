# Data Mashups in R

My version of the code from the Data Mashups in R book, which is sorely out-of-date.

After painstakingly working through the foreclosure mapping example and pouring over the [errata](http://oreilly.com/catalog/errata.csp?isbn=9780596804787), I decided to share my solution. The book requires using the Yahoo geocoding API, which is now a paid service. The errata acknowledges the API change but still requires you to use the paid XML service. I switched to the Google geocoding API with JSON.
